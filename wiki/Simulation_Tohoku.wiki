==Summary==

A conceptual cycle simulation of the Tohoku-Oki earthquake.
The megathrust event has a recurrence time of ~600 years,
and the deep brittle asperities produce high-frequency contains during the megathrust event.
These asperities also produce inter-megathrust M7 earthquakes recurring every several years.

==Introduction==

The 2010 Tohoku Great Earthquake was a devastating disaster to all human beings. It features outstanding characters as huge slip (>50m) towards the trench and high frequency radiations from the deeper part of the subduction zone during the megathrust event (with a possible recurrence time of ~1000 years), and numbers of M7 earthquakes between megathrust events. Here we perform quasi-dynamic simulations trying to reproduce these key features.

==Multi-cycle 2D simulations without deep brittle asperities ==

To reduce computational cost, it will be wise to perform a multi-cycle simulation in a 2D simulation (i.e. single cell along-dip) first.

This model comes with a velocity-weakening zone between 10km to 32 km in depth, and the effective normal stress linearly increases from surface (the trench) to 20km deep, then remain constant. The whole fault has a Dc (characteristic slip distance) of 0.4m. This parameter combination yields a multi-cycle megathrust events with recurrence time of ~1000 years and huge slip toward trench.

Figure 1: Simulation of multiple subduction earthquake cycles in 2D:

(a) Assumed depth-dependent distribution of rate-and-state friction parameters (a-b) and effective normal stress (Ïƒ). 
(b) Evolution of cumulated slip over several earthquake cycles. Each curve shows the slip as a function of depth at a certain time. The time intervals are irregularly sampled and longer than dynamic rupture timescales. The widely spaced profiles correspond to megathrust earthquakes. 
(c) Evolution of slip during a megathrust earthquake. Same representation as in (b), but with shorter time intervals. 
(d) Moment rate as a function of time over 10 earthquake cycles.

==3D simulations with deep brittle asperities==
This model comes with 11 brittle asperities randomly distributed at the deeper part of the subduction zone. The megathrust event has a recurrence time of ~600 years, and the deep brittle asperities produce high-frequency contains during the megathrust event. These asperities also produce inter-megathrust M7 earthquakes recurring every several years.
