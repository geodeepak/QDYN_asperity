= Tohoku cycle simulation =


A conceptual cycle simulation of the Tohoku-Oki earthquake.
The megathrush event has a recurrence time of ~600 years,
and the deep brittle asperities produce high-frequency contains during the megathrush event.
These asperities also produces inter-megathrush M7 earthquakes recurring every several years.

The upper panel shows the logarithmic slip-rate normalized by the plate velocity.

The lower panel shows the global peak slip-rate as a function of time, respectively.
