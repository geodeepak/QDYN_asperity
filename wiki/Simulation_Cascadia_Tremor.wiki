Simulation of complicated tremor migration patterns in Northern Cascadia.

The upper panel shows the logarithmic slip-rate normalized by the plate velocity.
The lower panel shows the slip-rate at the center of the fault (a profile along-strike).


== Tremor Simulation ==
By applying small, brittle asperities on the fault, we simulated tremors with complicated migration patterns.

The middle panel shows the logarithmic slip-rate normalized by the plate velocity.
The upper panel shows the corresponding seismicity.
The lower panel shows the slip-rate at the center of the fault (a profile along-strike).
The right panel shows the the global peak slip-rate as a function of time, respectively.
