(Priorities are not indicated)

Physics:
+ coupling slip to normal stress
+ slip-dependent friction law (Olivier Lengline is working on it)
+ in 2D: finite slab geometry (Pablo)
+ kernel for fault in infinite medium
+ variable strike
+ triangular elements: Meade's code (buggy?) or Gausian quadrature of Okada point sources
+ layered media: EDKS (Luis Rivera) or Relax (Sylvain Barbot)?
+ heterogeneous media: import kernel from Relax, Pylith, SPECFEM3D ?
+ set two spring-blocks model

Code engineering and optimization:
+ double FFT for planar faults in infinite medium
+ MPI parallelization
+ hierarchical matrix techniques (interface to Andrew Bradley's code)
+ inputs as fortran namelists
+ use object oriented matlab

Outputs:
+ binary outputs
+ more options to set output times: at regular times (with switch to short time during events), at regular increment of log(v)

Packaging:
+ documentation: automate sinc between manual doc and matlab help
+ add GPL license and copyright files
+ solve issue with Num.Rec. code license
+ clean up "download" area in webpage
+ add names (Windows / Mac) to executables in QDYN_release/executables download
+ add acknowledgements: Rubin for early code, Miyazaki for Okada's code, Ooura's fft
+ document equations and friction laws in manual
+ make it work with Octave (change output format, add note in manual)
+ set the path in fault_stress.f90 and qdyn.m via the Makefile, instead of manually
