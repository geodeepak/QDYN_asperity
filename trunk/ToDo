(Priorities are not indicated)

Physics:
+ slip-dependent friction term
+ coupling slip to normal stress
+ variable strike
+ triangular elements: Meade's code (buggy?) or Gausian quadrature of Okada point sources
+ layered media: EDKS (Luis Rivera) or Relax (Sylvain Barbot)?
+ heterogeneous media: import kernel from Relax, Pylith, SPECFEM3D ?

Code engineering and optimization:
+ inputs as fortran namelists
+ MPI parallelization
+ hierarchical matrix techniques
+ use object oriented matlab

Outputs:
+ binary outputs
+ more options to set output times: at regular times (with switch to short time during events), at regular increment of log(v)
+ matlab functions to read snapshots one by one

Packaging:
+ documentation: find a tool that allows automated actions (e.g. sinc with Matlab help)
+ add GPL license and copyright files
