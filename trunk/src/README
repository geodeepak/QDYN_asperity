QDYN is a Fortran 95 code with a Matlab wrapper
to compute quasi-dynamic earthquake cycles on faults
governed by rate-and-state friction,
embedded in a 2D or 3D elastic medium.

To get started:
	Open Matlab
	Add the qdyn directory to your path (addpath ...)
	Type 'help qdyn'
	Read the usage instructions

An example is provided: qdyn_example1.m

Note: 	In 2D, the option "FINITE=1" requires a table of kernel values tabulated on a file
	(e.g. kernel_I_8192.tab) that can be generated by the matlab function 
	TabKernelFiniteFlt.m
