module constants

! By convention let's write the name of constants in capitals,
! but beware that Fortran does not make a difference between capitalized and non-capitalized names
! (i.e. pi and PI are the same)

  double precision, parameter :: PI = 3.141592653589793d0
  double precision, parameter :: DAY = 3600.d0*24.d0, &
                                 WEEK = 7d0*DAY, &
                                 MONTH = 30*DAY, &
                                 YEAR = 365*DAY

end module constants
