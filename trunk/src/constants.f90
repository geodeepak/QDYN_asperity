 ! set OCTAVE_OUTPUT = .true. if you are using Octave instead of Matlab
  logical, parameter :: OCTAVE_OUTPUT = .false.

  character(*), parameter :: KERNEL_FILE = "~/3D_RUPTURE/qdyn/trunk/src/kernel_I_32768.tab"

! By convention let's write the name of constants in capitals,
! but beware that Fortran does not make a difference between capitalized and non-capitalized names
! (i.e. pi and PI are the same)
