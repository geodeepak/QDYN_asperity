QDYN is a Fortran code with a Matlab wrapper
to compute quasi-dynamic earthquake cycles on a 1D fault 
governed by rate-and-state friction
embedded in a 2D elastic medium.

To get started:
	Open Matlab
	Add the qdyn directory to your path (addpath ...)
	Type 'help qdyn'
	Read the usage instructions

An example is provided: qdyn_example1.m

Note: 	the option "FINITE=1" requires a table of kernel values tabulated on a file
	(kernel_I_8192.tab) that can be generated by the matlab function 
	TabKernelFiniteFlt.m
